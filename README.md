# AudioMNIST_with_LSTM
## Introduction
Audio MNIST dataset was used to train custom model architecture.
## Dataset: Audio MNIST
## Model Architecture
In first experiment bi-directional LSTM was used while in the second experiment, Encoder Decoder Architecture with LSTM was used to train the model.
## Results
Model achieved 99.06% accuracy with bi-directional architecture while 98.80% accuracy with Encoder Decoder architecture.
